      "description": "A Shining Example of Canine Paradise:  Bristoldogfield.co.uk  Secure Dog Exercise Field\r\nA few years ago, I found myself daydreaming about owning a small piece of land\u2014just a couple of acres where I could plant trees, grow some fruit bushes and vegetables, and most importantly, create a secure, beautiful space for my dogs to run free. I imagined that one day, I might even open it to the public so others could enjoy it too. Then, of course, the world changed\u2014Covid struck, land prices soared, and the dream seemed to drift just out of reach. Still, I held onto hope.\r\nThen one day, while scrolling Facebook, I stumbled upon a post by Karl Wilson announcing his plans to create a dog exercise field in Dundry, Bristol. I was stunned and delighted\u2014it was exactly what I had envisioned, but better yet, it was less than ten minutes from my home. I followed the journey from planning application to approval, cheering from the sidelines. But nothing could have prepared me for what Karl has actually achieved.\r\nThis week, I finally visited pawsforpleasure.co.uk Dog Field with my dogs and have time to add some images\u2014and to say I was blown away is an understatement.\r\nThis is not just a dog field. This is a canine sanctuary, crafted with love, intention, and remarkable attention to detail. From the moment you arrive, it\u2019s clear that nothing has been overlooked. The drive-in entrance and spacious turning circle are built to withstand the quirks of British weather. The field itself\u2014an expansive 4.5 acres\u2014is a thoughtful blend of manicured mown paths and wild, free-growing grasses. These paths meander naturally, inviting exploration rather than simply leading from A to B.\r\nEvery feature has been carefully designed for comfort and joy\u2014not just for the dogs, but for their humans too. There are canopied picnic benches for rest and reflection, and a shelter in the centre of the field for those unexpected showers. For the dogs? Think bridges, rocks, A-frames, high walks, tunnels, balance paths, and even a pond\u2014a full adventure playground catering to everything from the energetic explorer to the curious sniffer.\r\nBut the brilliance of this field doesn\u2019t end with its amenities or its breathtaking views of Bristol, The Clifton Suspension Bridge, The 2nd severn Crossing and beyond into wales. \r\nWhat truly elevates Dundry Dog Field to something exceptional is Karl\u2019s unwavering commitment to the environment. He hasn\u2019t just created a field; he\u2019s created an ecosystem. With wildflower meadows, layered hedgerows, specimen trees, and an owl box, this space is a thriving habitat-in-the-making for countless birds and wildlife. The sheer investment into the planting alone is nothing short of extraordinary\u2014Karl is quite literally planting a forest for the future.\r\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of speaking with Karl many times throughout the planning process, and one thing is abundantly clear: this isn\u2019t just a business. It\u2019s a legacy project. His vision reaches far beyond dog walks and day-to-day use. He understands, deeply, the value of trees, of natural beauty, of spaces that nourish both animals and people. His work is a gift not only to the local community today, but to generations to come. \r\n\"The true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\" \u2013 Nelson Henderson\r\nAs a homeopath for both people and pets, I understand the vital role that exercise, fresh air, and joy play in overall well-being. This activity ticks all the boxes\u2014for both our animals and ourselves.\r\nwww.homeopathypetcoaching.com & www.homeopathshaz.com \r\nIn Bristol terms, this place is \u201cgurt lush.\u201d It\u2019s everything you could dream of in a dog exercise field\u2014and more. Karl Wilson has created something truly outstanding, and it deserves recognition, celebration, and wholehearted support.\r\nBecause while the field is beautiful now, its true magic is in the future it's quietly growing\u2014with every pawprint on the path and every tree planted for tomorrow.",

Through the exclusive hire of our 2-acre secure dog walking park Poundon Pastures provides a safe, fun and secure environment to exercise and enjoy time with your dog. We have Secure 2m High Fencing, A Field Shelter, a drive in Secure Release Pen, Dog Wash Point and landscaped play features. Our site benefits from stunning and unique far reaching views over the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire countryside\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe've put a great deal of thought into providing features designed for dog enrichment for both physical and mental stimulation. With play features designed with skill development in mind including developing gross motor skills, scent finding, and natural dog enrichment areas. The secure fencing allows for off leash fun, allowing a dog's instincts to show themselves. Dogs of all breeds and temperaments are welcome here, but the fencing around the secure dog field makes it perfect for dog training, recall training, bitches in heat, and some types of reactive dogs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe drive-in secure release pen is the ultimate in security, operating an 'air lock' system so you drive in, shut and latch the gate behind you before letting your dog out of your car, and then enter the secure dog field through the coded gate. We also have some netting up to minimise reactivity between dogs from different sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe have a fully online secure booking system, allowing you to make and manage your bookings online from your account. You will receive a confirmation email, and a booking code to access the park 1 hour before your bookings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn-site we have a field shelter to get away from the elements, a dog wash-down point to clear up muddy paws and fresh mains drinking water. We do hope that you enjoy visiting us at Poundon Pastures and look forward to welcoming you soon!",

Located in Tutshill, walking distance from Chepstow town centre. We have two fields available for exclusive hire. A 3.5 acre exercise field containing some woodland (Big Field) and a Puppy Paddock of just over an acre. We have 6ft high fencing above ground dug into earth banking. We have aimed to make it escape proof for our dogs so we hope it will be for yours too! All booking slots are carefully planned so that you do not cross direct paths with another dog, there may however be one in the adjoining field. However, if you would rather have complete exclusivity then you have the option to book both fields, then that is also an option on the booking page. Our opening hours are from dawn till dusk so you can walk at a time to suit you. Our Big Field is ideal for both reactive dogs and dogs with poor recall. Or owners who just want to walk their dog off lead with the knowledge that they won\u2019t meet another reactive dog. The Puppy Paddock is perfect for young dogs who need to work on getting used to being in open spaces in a safe and controlled way. Or for smaller or older dogs who want to run and sniff around but not necessarily walk too far. It is also an ideal space for any owner to focus on some training with their four legged companion. We do not have any agility equipment but there are some things for doggy interest and a water trough is available in both to wash and cool your pooches down.",

The field has 6\u2032 high secure dog fencing which is high enough to ensure large dogs can\u2019t jump over it and small dogs can\u2019t squeeze through, and 3\u2032 fencing dug into the ground so they can\u2019t tunnel underneath it. Only one booking is possible per time slot, so you have the use of the field entirely to yourselves. The Sweetwell Fields secure dog walking area is suitable for a walk, dog training, and general recall training. For the comfort of all of our users and their dogs, the field includes a shelter, wash station, compostable dog waste bags and bin. Located on Mynyddislwyn, Blackwood, Caerphilly; Sweetwell Fields is available for private and group hire.",

Here at the Cwtch we offer a safe, stimulating and enriching environment for you and your dog to enjoy quality time together. Our secure fields are situated in the heart of the welsh country side, surrounded by 29 acres of organic fields and woodland, we are conveniently located near the M4, just 1.6 miles from Cwmbran and 3.6 miles from Newport. Our secure dog parks are ideal for dogs that cannot be let off the lead in public places \u2013 perhaps they don\u2019t enjoy meeting other dogs, or for those that lack recall. For dogs that feel anxious or nervous around other dogs, reactive dogs or simply just for dogs that need to work on training in an enclosed, safe environment. To put it simply, our Dog Adventure\u00a0Park is perfect for anyone who enjoys watching their dog be happy, fulfilled and free. Our secure fields are\u00a0available\u00a0for private hire. You will have exclusive use of either our Dog Adventure or Dog Sensory Park. Our coded gate system, and carefully planned time slots means that you won\u2019t be disturbed. \u200b Are you feeling ready to give up on ever having a relaxed walk? Fed up of looking over your shoulder, scouring the horizon for dogs or other distractions? Do you have a dog who is reactive to other dogs, one that runs away from you on walks? Or a dog that just seems under-challenged, under-stimulated, a dog that would love to have more fun? This is exactly why we created our secure, safe and stimulating dog parks. \u200b Our adventure park has over 10 different types of adventure play equipment & obstacles which means that your dog has plenty of challenges to stimulate and excite them. These include tunnels, ramps, log frames to climb, wooden houses and platforms, and climbing logs. Inside the park is a covered shelter and seating area where you can sit and relax whilst your dog runs, plays and explores. Our Adventure Play equipment introduces dogs to the world of jumping, climbing, balancing, crawling under and going around different obstacles. Our dog park helps with confidence and overcoming fears. It is a low-impact but challenging activity and can be varied according to age and fitness levels. \u200b",

      "description": "Haytor Mutt Mayhem is situated on Green Lane, Ilsington approx 0.6 mile from the top of Green Lane or 0.5 mile from the bottom. Our address is Northacombe, TQ13 9RB. The postcode will get you onto Green Lane but not to our house as it does the whole of the road for the houses on the higher side! Once on Green Lane don\u2019t turn off until you reach the farm then you will see our drive up to the field. There will be clear signs nearby to help and once you have arrived to point in correct direction. We are now on Google maps so use this code to get our exact location- H7HP+FG Ilsington, Newton Abbot What3Words-teams-signature-lavender Here at Haytor Mutt Mayhem we have made an area purpose built of approx 1.55 acres secured with 6ft 6\u2033 high deer fence to enable you to exercise your dog and let it go crazy whilst you can sit and enjoy the fabulous views either down the valley or up to Haytor. There is an enclosed unloading area for up to 2 cars which you enter and close the gate behind you before letting you dog out into the safety of the main paddock, where there are plenty of things to help keep them occupied or just run! There is a plenty of space to throw a ball, go through the tyres and have a swim in our large 1500 litre water trough. There is a field shelter with a picnic table in/beside (table will be outside in summer months and inside during winter) should you need to shelter from the elements, plus other seats around the paddock to sit an admire the views. Inside the shelter are spare poo bags, treats and toys for the dogs to use.\u200b So if your dog is a rescue, struggling with recall, has a high prey drive (desire to chase other things) or in season then the paddock will give you a place to do this safely. Or if your looking for some where peaceful to sit and enjoy time with your dog our paddock will be perfect! We are only a stones throw from Haytor on Green Lane, which is only a short drive from the A38. There are some amazing facilities locally for eating and drinking, we have The Carpenters Arms in Ilsington just 2 mins across the valley, Ullacombe Farm shop only 5 mins over the hill on route back to Bovey Tracey. Both allow dogs on site so perfect for after your exercise to enjoy a bite to eat and We are open to talking to local dog walkers, puppy training groups and other groups about the hire of our paddock as we do have ample parking outside the\u00a0 secure area. We do ask tho that there is no more than 3 dogs per person in the paddock at one time to ensure the poo is all cleared up.",

      "description": "A Shining Example of Canine Paradise:  Bristoldogfield.co.uk  Secure Dog Exercise Field A few years ago, I found myself daydreaming about owning a small piece of land\u2014just a couple of acres where I could plant trees, grow some fruit bushes and vegetables, and most importantly, create a secure, beautiful space for my dogs to run free. I imagined that one day, I might even open it to the public so others could enjoy it too. Then, of course, the world changed\u2014Covid struck, land prices soared, and the dream seemed to drift just out of reach. Still, I held onto hope. Then one day, while scrolling Facebook, I stumbled upon a post by Karl Wilson announcing his plans to create a dog exercise field in Dundry, Bristol. I was stunned and delighted\u2014it was exactly what I had envisioned, but better yet, it was less than ten minutes from my home. I followed the journey from planning application to approval, cheering from the sidelines. But nothing could have prepared me for what Karl has actually achieved. This week, I finally visited pawsforpleasure.co.uk Dog Field with my dogs and have time to add some images\u2014and to say I was blown away is an understatement. This is not just a dog field. This is a canine sanctuary, crafted with love, intention, and remarkable attention to detail. From the moment you arrive, it\u2019s clear that nothing has been overlooked. The drive-in entrance and spacious turning circle are built to withstand the quirks of British weather. The field itself\u2014an expansive 4.5 acres\u2014is a thoughtful blend of manicured mown paths and wild, free-growing grasses. These paths meander naturally, inviting exploration rather than simply leading from A to B. Every feature has been carefully designed for comfort and joy\u2014not just for the dogs, but for their humans too. There are canopied picnic benches for rest and reflection, and a shelter in the centre of the field for those unexpected showers. For the dogs? Think bridges, rocks, A-frames, high walks, tunnels, balance paths, and even a pond\u2014a full adventure playground catering to everything from the energetic explorer to the curious sniffer. But the brilliance of this field doesn\u2019t end with its amenities or its breathtaking views of Bristol, The Clifton Suspension Bridge, The 2nd severn Crossing and beyond into wales. What truly elevates Dundry Dog Field to something exceptional is Karl\u2019s unwavering commitment to the environment. He hasn\u2019t just created a field; he\u2019s created an ecosystem. With wildflower meadows, layered hedgerows, specimen trees, and an owl box, this space is a thriving habitat-in-the-making for countless birds and wildlife. The sheer investment into the planting alone is nothing short of extraordinary\u2014Karl is quite literally planting a forest for the future. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of speaking with Karl many times throughout the planning process, and one thing is abundantly clear: this isn\u2019t just a business. It\u2019s a legacy project. His vision reaches far beyond dog walks and day-to-day use. He understands, deeply, the value of trees, of natural beauty, of spaces that nourish both animals and people. His work is a gift not only to the local community today, but to generations to come. \u201cThe true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\u201d \u2013 Nelson Henderson As a homeopath for both people and pets, I understand the vital role that exercise, fresh air, and joy play in overall well-being. This activity ticks all the boxes\u2014for both our animals and ourselves. www.homeopathypetcoaching.com & www.homeopathshaz.com In Bristol terms, this place is \u201cgurt lush.\u201d It\u2019s everything you could dream of in a dog exercise field\u2014and more. Karl Wilson has created something truly outstanding, and it deserves recognition, celebration, and wholehearted support. Because while the field is beautiful now, its true magic is in the future it\u2019s quietly growing\u2014with every pawprint on the path and every tree planted for tomorrow.",

      "description": "Premium Secure Dog Walking Park. Through the exclusive hire of our 2-acre secure dog walking park Poundon Pastures provides a safe, fun and secure environment to exercise and enjoy time with your dog. We have Secure 2m High Fencing, A Field Shelter, a drive in Secure Release Pen, Dog Wash Point and landscaped play features. Our site benefits from stunning and unique far reaching views over the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire countryside We\u2019ve put a great deal of thought into providing features designed for dog enrichment for both physical and mental stimulation. With play features designed with skill development in mind including developing gross motor skills, scent finding, and natural dog enrichment areas. The secure fencing allows for off leash fun, allowing a dog\u2019s instincts to show themselves. Dogs of all breeds and temperaments are welcome here, but the fencing around the secure dog field makes it perfect for dog training, recall training, bitches in heat, and some types of reactive dogs. The drive-in secure release pen is the ultimate in security, operating an \u2018air lock\u2019 system so you drive in, shut and latch the gate behind you before letting your dog out of your car, and then enter the secure dog field through the coded gate. We also have some netting up to minimise reactivity between dogs from different sessions. We have a fully online secure booking system, allowing you to make and manage your bookings online from your account. You will receive a confirmation email, and a booking code to access the park 1 hour before your bookings. On-site we have a field shelter to get away from the elements, a dog wash-down point to clear up muddy paws and fresh mains drinking water. We do hope that you enjoy visiting us at Poundon Pastures and look forward to welcoming you soon!",

Should the worse happen we have a fully stocked first aid kit in Betty\u2019s Bothy (and we hope we never have to use it!) Our main passion in life is our dogs- our team is currently made up of our labradors \u2013 Betty, Ivy, Skye, Midge and Evie. We have two Parks set up here- you\u2019ll find more information on their individual pages. The Play Park and the Wild Park. We run weekly Puppy/Social and Breed meets. To find the current list of meets click on the Events Page or to find out more information click on the Meets page. We cater to all types of dogs- whether your dog is human or dog reactive, in season, wants to socialise, celebrate a birthday or gotcha day, do some training, or just do something different we can help. We also welcome dog walkers, trainers and pet photographers. Bring a picnic, coffee and the kids and have an absolute blast at Zoomies Aberdeen.",

Located in Tutshill, walking distance from Chepstow town centre. We have two fields available for exclusive hire. A 3.5 acre exercise field containing some woodland (Big Field) and a Puppy Paddock of just over an acre. We have 6ft high fencing above ground dug into earth banking. We have aimed to make it escape proof for our dogs so we hope it will be for yours too! All booking slots are carefully planned so that you do not cross direct paths with another dog, there may however be one in the adjoining field. However, if you would rather have complete exclusivity then you have the option to book both fields, then that is also an option on the booking page. Our opening hours are from dawn till dusk so you can walk at a time to suit you. Our Big Field is ideal for both reactive dogs and dogs with poor recall. Or owners who just want to walk their dog off lead with the knowledge that they won\u2019t meet another reactive dog. The Puppy Paddock is perfect for young dogs who need to work on getting used to being in open spaces in a safe and controlled way. Or for smaller or older dogs who want to run and sniff around but not necessarily walk too far. It is also an ideal space for any owner to focus on some training with their four legged companion. We do not have any agility equipment but there are some things for doggy interest and a water trough is available in both to wash and cool your pooches down.",

The field has 6\u2032 high secure dog fencing which is high enough to ensure large dogs can\u2019t jump over it and small dogs can\u2019t squeeze through, and 3\u2032 fencing dug into the ground so they can\u2019t tunnel underneath it. Only one booking is possible per time slot, so you have the use of the field entirely to yourselves. The Sweetwell Fields secure dog walking area is suitable for a walk, dog training, and general recall training. For the comfort of all of our users and their dogs, the field includes a shelter, wash station, compostable dog waste bags and bin. Located on Mynyddislwyn, Blackwood, Caerphilly; Sweetwell Fields is available for private and group hire.",

Here at the Cwtch we offer a safe, stimulating and enriching environment for you and your dog to enjoy quality time together. Our secure fields are situated in the heart of the welsh country side, surrounded by 29 acres of organic fields and woodland, we are conveniently located near the M4, just 1.6 miles from Cwmbran and 3.6 miles from Newport. Our secure dog parks are ideal for dogs that cannot be let off the lead in public places \u2013 perhaps they don\u2019t enjoy meeting other dogs, or for those that lack recall. For dogs that feel anxious or nervous around other dogs, reactive dogs or simply just for dogs that need to work on training in an enclosed, safe environment. To put it simply, our Dog Adventure\u00a0Park is perfect for anyone who enjoys watching their dog be happy, fulfilled and free. Our secure fields are\u00a0available\u00a0for private hire. You will have exclusive use of either our Dog Adventure or Dog Sensory Park. Our coded gate system, and carefully planned time slots means that you won\u2019t be disturbed. \u200b Are you feeling ready to give up on ever having a relaxed walk? Fed up of looking over your shoulder, scouring the horizon for dogs or other distractions? Do you have a dog who is reactive to other dogs, one that runs away from you on walks? Or a dog that just seems under-challenged, under-stimulated, a dog that would love to have more fun? This is exactly why we created our secure, safe and stimulating dog parks. \u200b Our adventure park has over 10 different types of adventure play equipment & obstacles which means that your dog has plenty of challenges to stimulate and excite them. These include tunnels, ramps, log frames to climb, wooden houses and platforms, and climbing logs. Inside the park is a covered shelter and seating area where you can sit and relax whilst your dog runs, plays and explores. Our Adventure Play equipment introduces dogs to the world of jumping, climbing, balancing, crawling under and going around different obstacles. Our dog park helps with confidence and overcoming fears. It is a low-impact but challenging activity and can be varied according to age and fitness levels. \u200b",

      "description": "Haytor Mutt Mayhem is situated on Green Lane, Ilsington approx 0.6 mile from the top of Green Lane or 0.5 mile from the bottom. Our address is Northacombe, TQ13 9RB. The postcode will get you onto Green Lane but not to our house as it does the whole of the road for the houses on the higher side! Once on Green Lane don\u2019t turn off until you reach the farm then you will see our drive up to the field. There will be clear signs nearby to help and once you have arrived to point in correct direction. We are now on Google maps so use this code to get our exact location- H7HP+FG Ilsington, Newton Abbot What3Words-teams-signature-lavender Here at Haytor Mutt Mayhem we have made an area purpose built of approx 1.55 acres secured with 6ft 6\u2033 high deer fence to enable you to exercise your dog and let it go crazy whilst you can sit and enjoy the fabulous views either down the valley or up to Haytor. There is an enclosed unloading area for up to 2 cars which you enter and close the gate behind you before letting you dog out into the safety of the main paddock, where there are plenty of things to help keep them occupied or just run! There is a plenty of space to throw a ball, go through the tyres and have a swim in our large 1500 litre water trough. There is a field shelter with a picnic table in/beside (table will be outside in summer months and inside during winter) should you need to shelter from the elements, plus other seats around the paddock to sit an admire the views. Inside the shelter are spare poo bags, treats and toys for the dogs to use.\u200b So if your dog is a rescue, struggling with recall, has a high prey drive (desire to chase other things) or in season then the paddock will give you a place to do this safely. Or if your looking for some where peaceful to sit and enjoy time with your dog our paddock will be perfect! We are only a stones throw from Haytor on Green Lane, which is only a short drive from the A38. There are some amazing facilities locally for eating and drinking, we have The Carpenters Arms in Ilsington just 2 mins across the valley, Ullacombe Farm shop only 5 mins over the hill on route back to Bovey Tracey. Both allow dogs on site so perfect for after your exercise to enjoy a bite to eat and We are open to talking to local dog walkers, puppy training groups and other groups about the hire of our paddock as we do have ample parking outside the\u00a0 secure area. We do ask tho that there is no more than 3 dogs per person in the paddock at one time to ensure the poo is all cleared up.",

      "description": "The Secret Dog Garden\u00a0is an enclosed canine enrichment facility which allows your dog to focus on their natural behaviours \u2013 sniff, search, investigate and explore, providing them with a complete mental and physical workout. (Please note the area is approximately 50metres by 50metres.) The area is designed from the dog\u2019s point of view with sensory planting including lavender and rosemary, recycled objects with a scent history such as children\u2019s toys, horse rugs and brushes, shoes and boots, hats and gloves, bicycle tyres and brooms. Scent cloths, feathers, and other items with various animal smells can also be discovered. Dogs see in a range of blue and yellow so items have been chosen to reflect this to give them a visual experience as well as an olfactory workout. Different textiles have been used to enhance the sense of touch with gravel, stone and wooden paving slabs around the outside areas, and indoor areas have non-slip mats of various material such as nylon, foam and natural fur, plus hanging items to brush against like scarves and beads. Our Great British birds provide a natural soundtrack in the garden, and indoor areas have bells, rattles and other items that make a sound when nudged with a nose. How your dog moves around the area is considered with different levels to reach via ramps or steps, plus objects to step over, step on, or avoid, dependent on your dog\u2019s preference. As your dog moves around and explores, they will discover natural treats hidden in boxes, puzzles, snuffle mats and even ball pits. The Secret Dog Garden gives your dog the opportunity to simply be a dog, allowing them to make their own choices and explore at their own pace. For this reason, only one dog can visit at any one time, as it is their experience for them to enjoy undistracted. As all dogs are unique, each experience is planned on an individual basis taking into account your dog\u2019s preferences, age and ability, character and behaviour, and the layout is adapted accordingly. It is also your opportunity for you to relax and simply observe your dog\u2019s natural behaviour. On subsequent visits, the environment can be changed to reflect your dog\u2019s preferences or provide additional opportunities.",

We want all our dog owners and their dogs to experience this adventure play ground in a safe and secure enclosure and we are developing it further adding new adventures and facilities for all to enjoy \u2013 take a look through our website and gallery pictures\u2026 We are pleased to announce that a regular Dog Training class will be starting at our Dog Park very soon too (more details to be provided soon) for those needing additional support with their dogs. Our Dog Park is the perfect answer for many.\u00a0We accommodate those dogs who have temperament issues and those dogs who have hearing difficulties or are disobedient. Your dog may be recovering from an illness or has bad attitudes to other dogs or people. Maybe your dog is elderly or timid and just wants to be left alone to do there only thing in there own time. You may have a dog which is a valuable show dog or your dog may be on heat \u00a0and you don\u2019t want other dogs getting involved or close to your dog. We hope you and your dogs enjoy\u00a0the adventure play equipment specially made to keep your dog interested and entertained while you relax or you may want to participate with your dog. For those long winter nights we have installed flood lights and for those hot summer days a picnic area where you can sit and relax and watch your dogs happily play. You can book either as a personal booking where you get to enjoy the facilities on your own or as a social booking where you can meet and interact with other dogs and owners.",

      "description": "Crabtree Canine Enrichment Centre, Crowborough, East Sussex TN16 1UB Crabtree has been is a very special place which has been put together for dogs of all ages and breeds. It is situated just outside of Crowborough in East Sussex and backs onto the Ashdown Forest. It has been created with many things in mind in particular to encourage dogs to do what they really enjoy in a natural setting. It is individually set up for each dog that visits. Crabtree is an enrichment area, not an off lead field, and sessions are set up and monitored and which last from 45 minutes to an hour. Enrichment areas are places where dogs are invited to explore and finding food is part of the session, and\u00a0 only good quality foods are used. Enrichment activities are really helpful for any dogs as they combine to provide sensory experiences and things to interact with which encourage proprioception and flexibility. Because Crabtree is part of a natural environment there are also many scents of the various animals that live in the area. Dogs need to be on a long lead and harness during a visit as this is shared experience between the dog and handler. This also helps dogs to build confidence in unknown areas and is especially helpful for recently rescued dogs, dogs that are undergoing rehab, dogs with behaviour issues as well as puppies. Crabtree comprises of 3 separate areas which comprise of an outdoor area, and 2 stables all provide slightly different experiences for dogs. Please note at there is no website at the moment, if you would like to know more or book a session please contact Pennie Clayton 07910 720961",

The field is split into a 2 acre highly secure field with 6ft fences and a 4 acre field with 4.5ft fences. You are welcome to use both fields but the 4 acre field is not guaranteed to be completely secure. Please don\u2019t use the 4 acre field unless your dog has basic recall. The field is located just off of the B4195 (Bewdley Road North). The field and the road it is on do not have an address but we are happy to provide directions via phone or email if needed.

We wanted a secure environment to let some of our doggies who didn\u2019t have great recall off their lead so they could play with the other dogs so started looking round for a suitable field. We found a plot of 1.6 acres on Slaymaker Lane in Oakworth and just fell in love. The beautiful countryside is an idyllic backdrop. We purchased the field in 2020 and have created a completely secure environment with a 2m fence all around. Having a family dog who can\u2019t be off lead in open spaces, we understand how important it is to have somewhere your fur baby can run and just be a dog, without the worry of bumping into others. So we opened up our little piece of paradise for people to use on an individual basis. We have balls, launchers and rope toys available for use, alongside a small shelter to get out of the British weather! We also have sun shades, paddling pools and hammocks during the summertime. It is the perfect space for off lead walkies, training or just chilling out with your fur babies, safe in the knowledge that your beloved pooch is safe and sound.",

      "description": "Welcome to Towpath Tails Dog Park, a safe and calm environment for your dog to run, sniff, play and learn to their doggy hearts delight\u2026and for you to relax and chill out in the rural canal-side setting while they have fun. Nestled within our own Christmas tree farm and alongside the beautiful Kennet and Avon canal in Wootton Rivers, Towpath Tails Dog Park offers all dog owners a peaceful corner of the Wiltshire countryside where they can let their dogs off lead safely to have the fun and freedom they deserve.Whether you want to train your puppy, let your older dog have a rummage,\u00a0rootle and a run, improve your dog\u2019s recall or you have a rescue dog where you need a safe space\u00a0to help you build mutual trust and their confidence \u2013 Towpath Tails Dog Park is the perfect place. We offer two play areas \u2013 The Paddock and The Coppice. The Paddock is about half an acre with agility equipment and definitely LARGE ENOUGH FOR RUNNING AND PLAY, but also safe and small enough to keep watch and train. While The Coppice is a larger 3acre space with a mix of dense and loosely wooded areas. A BIG SPACE FOR RUNNING and SNIFFING, but also great for training and recall. Our dog exercise areas are both securely fenced with 6\u2019ft high tensile fencing \u2013 for keeping the \u2018jumpers\u2019\u00a0safe; and low rabbit fencing for keeping the \u2018diggers\u2019 in. SECURE \u2013 Both of the play areas within Towpath Tails Dog Park are secure spaces available for private individual hire as well as for dog training and events. Both The Paddock and The Coppice have secure 6ft deer fencing all around the field pegged to the ground, with additional rabbit fencing around the bottom and both have various forms of additional screening. Both play areas have access to the secure gated car park from which there is then a further locked secure gate into the respective play area. Both The Paddock and The Coppice then each have a further access gate fenced to 6ft high with low level rabbit fencing for double security. FACILITIES \u2013 The play areas are situated well off the village road and are accessed through a gated secure private car park. The Paddock includes three jumps, a small tube, tyres and a pallet ramp for play. For the humans, there is a shelter with table and chairs and a clear view down the field. Water is provided, as is a poo bin. And sanitiser is available. The Coppice is a mix of densely packed and more openly spaced mature Christmas trees for a sniffers heaven. There is a shelter with a bench seat, water, a small paddling pool and a poo bin.\u00a0 We visit both areas regularly to check the grounds, facilities and fencing, to top up the water, and to ensure that everything runs smoothly for when you arrive. OPENING HOURS \u2013 Our opening times vary by month but are generally in line with dawn & dusk hours. Some booking slots are restricted in\u00a0late Nov & Dec when the Xmas tree farm is at its busiest. BOOKINGS \u2013 We welcome individuals, families, as well as professional dog walkers and dog trainers. Bookings can be made online with a live calendar booking system at www.towpathtails.com. Individuals, families, and dog walkers can book for 30mins or 1hour\u00a0with dog training and events bookings available for longer. First time visitors should book an induction session and will be met and shown how everything works by David or Isaac. We look forward to seeing you when you visit.",

The Key features of The Frog & Dog: 1.8m High fencing \u2013 ensures no matter how well your dog can jump, they will still struggle to get over the fence. 10cm additional fencing is buried underground \u2013 most dogs love to dig while they have fun, and this can be very hazardous for some fields since it provides a way for the dog to escape. However, at the Frog & Dog, they will be unable to dig under it. Anti-snag netting \u2013 may netting types can be harmful to dog coats if they rub against them, especially longer haired breeds. The netting we use does not have sharp joins on the netting itself to ensure your dog\u2019s coat will remain protected. 1.5 Acre field \u2013 provides a large area to play with your dog Located away from main roads \u2013 Frog Lane is a no through road and as such does not have cars passing by the field which would be distracting. Easy and hassle free access \u2013 you are easily able to pull up to or onto the field in your car without the fear of getting lost or stuck on bad terrain. Booking your time at the Frog & Dog is very easy, simply go to www.theFrogandDog.co.uk",

LocationThe Paddocks, Saxon Green, Escomb, Bishop Auckland DL14 7SY Tucked away in the village of Escomb, The Paddocks is our family home which comes with 1.5 acres of land. Being huge dog owners, we immediately fell in love with the place. The first thing we did when we moved in was to have 6ft solid fencing erected all around the property, to make it both safe for our dogs and private for us. On one corner of the land we set up a dog-friendly holiday let called Paddock Lodge. Happily that still left us with a large grassy area, which is now our dog field \u2013 somewhere we can relax when exercising our dogs.

      "description": "Introductory rate \u00a35 per hour. Normal rate \u00a310 per hour. Hollin Wood is a 3 acre wood based in Broomfield Maidstone Kent. The wood sits on a hillside flanked on either side by shallow valleys; the plateaux at the top has an unusual plantation of standard chestnuts. The lower slopes are home to young silver birch. Access is good being off the A20 with its own private gated entrance. There is a packed earth track running along either side of the wood for parking one vehicle at a time. On the West side there is sand/loam soil that has been extracted leaving a shallow quarry. Providing a perfect area in the woodland for dogs to\u00a0investigate and prevent them from getting bored. There are lots of different areas that give dogs a lot to explore. There is a water station for the dogs at the front pedestrian access gate. We have provided two access points for safety, and request that you do not smoke whilst in the wood in case of fire. Hollin Wood is in what were the lands of the Leeds Castle Estate, and is considered ancient woodland that needs to be protected and is now in private ownership. The site is triangular in shape. Two sides are fenced with 6 ft chain link fence and the back edge is secured with stock fencing and strong chicken wire dug into the ground. The wood is part of a larger area called Castle wood, which links to the Len Valley Walk (LDWA) and as such has a lot to offer you in terms of extending your walk from being off lead in Hollin Wood to an on lead 5 mile walk into Lenham. Additionally, there is a dog friendly pub on the A20, a 10 minute walk from the wood called \u2018The Gate Inn Pub\u2019 which not only allows dogs in the garden but also serves food. We hope you make the most of your experience with us and enjoy not just the wood, but your local area too.",

It\u2019s a popular favourite with owners of young or energetic dogs due to having a small hill, which dogs can run up and down to burn energy. At 3 acres, there is lots of space for zoomies, games or a medium length walk. The field also has: \u2013 A Splash Pool \u2013 Dig Pit \u2013 Scurry Run \u2013 Permanent Obstacles & Commercial Agility Equipment \u2013 Tunnels \u2013 Walking Paths \u2013 Both Long Grass & Short Grass To Suit Your Dog\u2019s Preference \u2013 Much more . . . There has been significant investment in 6ft professional fencing, camouflage netting and ground reinforcement so it\u2019s fully enclosed and more secure under foot all year round in high traffic areas. It is called the Half Past Field as timeslots start on the HALF HOUR rather than on the hour. This field has low level lighting for darker days and drains well. It is therefore open all year round between 06:30am and 20:20pm. Slots are booked on an exclusive use basis with a 10 minute changeover between bookings so that dogs and visitors don\u2019t have to bump into each other. Come and try it out !",

      "description": "2 Acre Secure Dog walking Woodland Would you love to be able to walk your dog(s) off lead through the woods? With no fear of meeting other dogs, other people along the way or without having concerns about your dog running off? Well at Stanton Waters Woodland Walks that\u2019s just what you can do. Come and try it for yourself. About Stanton Waters Woodland Walks Stanton Waters Woodland Walks is a secure private hire 2-acre woodland, set within the backdrop of 50 acres of secluded farm land. It boasts a fully enclosed hard standing car park, an enchanting trail that loops around the 2 acres of woodland with a green open space running through the heart of the woods that is perfect for ball throwing or dog training. We are located on the outskirts of Swindon near the beautiful village of Blunsdon. The entire 2 acres is securely fenced with 6ft of stock fencing and a secure entrance gate. It has good road links just an 18-minute drive from J15 of the M4 or a 15-minute drive from Cirencester. We offer long opening hours to find a time that suits you. We feel confident you will love the woods as much as we do. Stanton Waters Woodland Walks is accessed via a private off-road track after you turn off the B4019. The track is suitable for all cars (but modified or low-slung cars may need to check prior to visit). This leads you up to a private car park that is enclosed within the 2 acres of woodland. It is the perfect size to accommodate 2 cars comfortably and safe for unloading and loading your dog(s). For your convenience there is also access to an outside tap with fresh running water, unfortunately this may not be available in the colder extreme weather. \u00a0 (Security cameras are in operation)",
